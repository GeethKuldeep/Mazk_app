# Vibranium

Dormammu is our solution to ensure covid-19 precautions in most public places in the most non-contact way possible. Our non contact apparatus will automatically screen people with symptoms. Which eliminates the need for contact with the middlemen as well.
This hardware will be integrated with our app which will indicate which places are crowded and which places to avoid
